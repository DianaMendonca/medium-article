      <h2>Let the madness begin:</h2>
      <p>
        So what is HTML?
        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h2>Wheres is the madness in all of this:</h2>
      <p>
        Well first the syntax of HTML is completely baloney.
        You need to start and finish exactly with the same syntax, give a letter so it can be edited later in CSS, another matter that we will need to deal with later on.
        But for now we're stuck with the HTML.
      </p>
      <a href="#" class="link-medium">Click Me For More Information!</a>
      <h2>Nothing happened:</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, nothing happened by clicking that title, that's part of the madness of HTML, I can simply put a clickable title that will redirect the user into a random page.
        Good luck for the future, godspeed traveler!
